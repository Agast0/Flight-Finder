# Flight Finder
 
The application is able to find all flights from an origin city to the destination city based on the graph below. It works for other graphs too, however, the txt files must be changed.

In the figure, each vertex corresponds to a city and each edge represents a flight between two cities.
Each edge has a flight id and a cost. For example, in the figure, the red colored edge’s id is “11” and
its cost is “100”.
